# Markdown Content Renderer This project provides a simple, single-file HTML application that renders Markdown content from an `input.md` file into a responsive webpage. It leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and `marked.js` for Markdown to HTML conversion. ## Features *   **Single-File HTML:** Easy to deploy and use, no build step required. *   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. *   **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Automatically converts `input.md` to displayable HTML. *   **Modern Styling:** Clean and readable layout. ## Usage 1.  Place the `index.html` file in your desired directory. 2.  Ensure your Markdown content is saved as `input.md` in the **same directory** as `index.html`. 3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser. The application will automatically fetch `input.md`, convert its content to HTML, and display it within the page. ## Technologies Used *   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page. *   **Tailwind CSS:** For responsive and modern styling. *   **Marked.js:** A fast and lightweight Markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
